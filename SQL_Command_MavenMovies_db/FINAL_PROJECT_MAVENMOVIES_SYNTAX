1Q) My partner and I want to come by each of the stores in person and meet the managers. 
Please send over the managers’ names at each store, with the full address 
of each property (street address, district, city, and country please).  

Solution:

Select
   staff.First_name as first_name,
   staff.last_name as last_name,
   store.store_id as store_id,
   address.address as address,
   address.address2 as address2,
   address.district as district,
   city.city as city,
   country.country as country
from staff
left join store
on staff.store_id= store.store_id
left join address
on store.address_id = address.address_id
left join city
on address.city_id = city.city_id
left join country
on city.country_id = country.country_id;

	
2Q) I would like to get a better understanding of all of the inventory that would come along with the business. 
Please pull together a list of each inventory item you have stocked, including the store_id number, 
the inventory_id, the name of the film, the film’s rating, its rental rate and replacement cost. 

Solution: 
select
   film.title as Movie_name,
   film.rental_rate as rental_rates,
   film.replacement_cost as Replacement_cost,
   film.rating as ratings,
   Inventory.store_id as store_id,
   Inventory.Inventory_id as Inventory_id
from film
	left join Inventory
    on film.film_id = inventory.inventory_id
    group by Store_id, Movie_name, Ratings, Rental_rates, Replacement_cost, Inventory_id;

 
3Q) From the same list of films you just pulled, please roll that data up and provide a summary level overview 
of your inventory. We would like to know how many inventory items you have with each rating at each store. 

Solution:






4. Similarly, we want to understand how diversified the inventory is in terms of replacement cost. We want to 
see how big of a hit it would be if a certain category of film became unpopular at a certain store.
We would like to see the number of films, as well as the average replacement cost, and total replacement cost, 
sliced by store and film category. 
5.	We want to make sure you folks have a good handle on who your customers are. Please provide a list 
of all customer names, which store they go to, whether or not they are currently active, 
and their full addresses – street address, city, and country. 
6.	We would like to understand how much your customers are spending with you, and also to know 
who your most valuable customers are. Please pull together a list of customer names, their total 
lifetime rentals, and the sum of all payments you have collected from them. It would be great to 
see this ordered on total lifetime value, with the most valuable customers at the top of the list. 

7. My partner and I would like to get to know your board of advisors and any current investors.
Could you please provide a list of advisor and investor names in one table? 
Could you please note whether they are an investor or an advisor, and for the investors, 
it would be good to include which company they work with. 
8. We're interested in how well you have covered the most-awarded actors. 
Of all the actors with three types of awards, for what % of them do we carry a film?
And how about for actors with two types of awards? Same questions. 
Finally, how about actors with just one award?
